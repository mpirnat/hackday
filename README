The "Hack Day" Web App
======================

A friendly little website for helping your organization run a Hack Day event.
We aim to address:

    * participant registration
    * team creation and management
    * project memorialization (file upload)
    * communications
        * blog
        * twitter
        * facebook
        * email
    * staff-managed wiki
    * voting
    * site themes

The site is built on Django 1.3 and Python 2.7.

Developing
----------

Get a virtualenv all set up:

    virtualenv --python=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python hackday
    cd hackday
    . bin/activate
    mkdir db
    mkdir tmp
    cd tmp/
    wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.1/tarball/
    tar zxvf Django-1.3.1.tar.gz
    cd Django-1.3.1
    python setup.py install

We strive for PEP-8ness, clean code, and test coverage.

Additional Packages
-------------------

Install django-debug-toolbar:

    * pip install django-debug-toolbar

Settings have already been added to settings.py. You will likely need to change the INTERNAL_IPS to reflect your dev system, unless you are working locally. 


Install django-taggit:

    * pip install django-taggit

This is necessary otherwise blogs will break.
